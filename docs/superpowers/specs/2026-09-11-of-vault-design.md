title: of-vault — login and access control for Observable Framework sites
status: draft

# of-vault design

Login and access control for static Observable Framework sites, with the data files
protected too. A Cloudflare Worker wraps a Framework build: Better Auth handles users
and sessions, D1 stores them, R2 holds the built site. The Framework site is a black
box to the vault; it needs no changes.

First user: ICR's `campaignhq` at dashboards.healthcampaigns.org. Its current Worker
(`icr/campaignhq/worker/index.js`) already serves the build from R2; of-vault lifts that
serving logic and puts a session gate in front of it.

## Goals

- Whole site behind login by default. Every HTML page, script, parquet, and pmtiles
  file goes through the same session check.
- Per-path rules that make listed pages public or disabled.
- Sign-in by email + password or magic link. Anyone can sign up; an admin approves.
- A minimal admin page: list users, approve, disable, set role, delete.
- Reusable for any Framework site. ICR proves it; packaging comes later.

## Non-goals (v1)

- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft).
- Per-role page rules. Rules are public / protected / disabled only.
- Multiple sites in one Worker.
- npm packaging. v1 is a template repo cloned per site.
- Password reset beyond "send me a magic link".
- Hiding disabled pages from the site's sidebar. The build is static; remove the
  page from the Framework config to hide the link.

## Architecture

```
browser ──▶ Cloudflare Worker (Hono)
              ├─ /auth/*        Better Auth handler          (public)
              ├─ /vault/login   login page                   (public)
              ├─ /vault/pending "awaiting approval" page     (public)
              ├─ /vault/admin   user table + actions         (role: admin)
              └─ /*             page rules → session gate → R2 static serve
D1  ─ users, sessions, verification tokens (Better Auth schema + `status` field)
R2  ─ `_site/<name>/…`  the Framework dist/
Resend ─ magic-link and approval emails (console fallback when no API key)
```

Runtime: Cloudflare Workers. Bindings: D1 `DB`, R2 `SITE`. Secrets:
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`. The site is stored in R2 rather than Workers
Static Assets because DuckDB-WASM's engine builds exceed the 25 MiB per-file cap.

## Request flow

Routes are matched in this order:

1. `/auth/*` → Better Auth. Always public.
2. `/vault/login`, `/vault/pending` → rendered pages. Always public. A signed-in
   active user hitting `/vault/login` is redirected to `next` or `/`.
3. `/vault/admin` and its form-post actions → require session with role `admin`.
   Otherwise 404 (do not reveal the page exists).
4. Everything else:
   1. Resolve the request path against the page rules (below). Result is `public`,
      `protected`, or `disabled`.
   2. `disabled` → 404 for everyone, including admins.
   3. `protected` → read session from cookie.
      - No session → 302 to `/vault/login?next=<path>` for navigations
        (`Accept: text/html`); 401 with no body for asset and data fetches, so a
        stale tab fails visibly instead of caching a redirect into DuckDB.
      - Session, user `status` is `pending` or `disabled` → 302 to `/vault/pending`
        for navigations, 403 for fetches.
      - Session, `active` → serve.
   4. `public` → serve.
   5. Serve = the R2 static logic from campaignhq's Worker: cleanUrls (`/about` →
      `about.html`, `/` → `index.html`), range requests, ETag/304, content types,
      site 404 page. Cache headers change: protected responses are
      `Cache-Control: private, max-age=…` so the Cloudflare edge never caches a
      protected file for an anonymous request; hashed assets keep the long max-age,
      still private. Public responses keep campaignhq's public cache headers.

Data protection works because Framework builds fetch parquet and pmtiles from the
same origin under `/_file/…`. The browser sends the session cookie on same-origin
fetches, including range requests, so the gate covers them with no site changes.

If D1 is unreachable, the gate fails closed: 503, never a served file.

## Page rules

`vault.config.js` carries an ordered list. First match wins. Anything unmatched is
`protected`. Patterns are path globs matched against the request path with no leading
slash; `*` does not cross `/`, `**` does.

```js
pages: [
  {match: "about",                        access: "public"},
  {match: "_file/data/calendar.*.parquet", access: "public"},
  {match: "ntd",                          access: "disabled"},
  {match: "ntd/**",                       access: "disabled"},
]
```

Rules for the Framework runtime:

- `_observablehq/**`, `_npm/**`, `_import/**` are code, not data. They become
  `public` automatically whenever any rule is `public`, so a public page can load.
  A `disabled` or `protected` rule naming them explicitly still wins. Consequence,
  stated in the README: never put secrets in a data loader's JavaScript output, since
  `_import/` ships to the browser.
- `_file/**` is data and stays `protected` unless a rule says otherwise. Framework
  hashes file names (`_file/data/calendar.abc123.parquet`), so public data rules
  use a glob on the base name and extension.
- A public page whose data is not also public renders but its charts fail with 401.
  The deploy script warns when a public rule matches an HTML page and no public rule
  matches anything under `_file/`.

## Auth

Better Auth on D1 through Kysely's D1 dialect. Better Auth is constructed per
request because Workers expose bindings only at request time; the construction is
cheap and cached on the Hono context.

Plugins:

- **email-and-password** — sign-up and sign-in.
- **magic-link** — passwordless sign-in and the only password-reset path in v1.
- **admin** — roles (`user`, `admin`), list users, ban/unban. We do not use ban for
  approval; see `status`.

Extra user field `status`: `pending` | `active` | `disabled`.

- A sign-up hook sets `pending`. If `auth.allowedDomains` is set and the email's
  domain is in it, the hook sets `active` instead.
- The first user ever created gets role `admin` and status `active`, so the deployer
  can never be locked out.
- Sign-in of a `pending` or `disabled` user succeeds at the Better Auth level but the
  gate sends them to `/vault/pending`. This keeps Better Auth's flows untouched.

Sessions: stored in D1, cookie `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`, lifetime
`auth.sessionDays` (default 30). Rate limiting: Better Auth's built-in limiter on
`/auth/sign-in/*` and `/auth/magic-link/*`, per IP.

Email: Resend HTTP API. When `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset the sender logs the message and
link to the console, which is the local-dev path. Emails sent: magic link, "your
account was approved", and an admin notification on new sign-up.

## Pages the Worker renders

Plain HTML templates as JavaScript template strings, one shared stylesheet, no
client-side framework. Themed by `brand.title`, `brand.logo`, `brand.accent`.

- **Login** (`/vault/login`): email + password form, a "email me a link" button, a
  sign-up link. Auth errors render back into this page as a message.
- **Sign up** (`/vault/signup`): email, password. On success, redirect to
  `/vault/pending`.
- **Pending** (`/vault/pending`): "your account is waiting for approval", sign-out.
  Also shown to `disabled` users with different wording.
- **Admin** (`/vault/admin`): table of users — email, status, role, created, last
  sign-in — with per-row form-post actions: approve, disable, make admin, remove
  admin, delete. Actions POST to `/vault/admin/<action>` with a CSRF token bound to
  the session. An admin cannot disable or delete themself.

## Config

```js
// vault.config.js
export default {
  site:  {name: "campaignhq", dist: "../icr/campaignhq/dist"},
  brand: {title: "Campaign Dashboards", accent: "#0b57d0", logo: null},
  auth:  {allowedDomains: ["ona.io", "unicef.org"], sessionDays: 30},
  mail:  {from: "vault@healthcampaigns.org", adminNotify: "mberg@ona.io"},
  pages: [
    {match: "about", access: "public"},
  ],
};
```

`site.dist` is used only by the deploy script. `site.name` is the R2 prefix
(`_site/<name>/`). Everything else is read by the Worker at build time: the deploy
script inlines the config into the bundle so the Worker never reads the filesystem.

## Repo layout

```
of-vault/
  README.md
  package.json          hono, better-auth, kysely, kysely-d1, wrangler, vitest
  wrangler.toml         bindings, routes (per deployment)
  vault.config.js       per deployment
  migrations/           D1 SQL from `better-auth generate` + the status column
  deploy.sh             build site → rclone sync dist → wrangler d1 migrations apply → wrangler deploy
  src/
    index.js            Hono app, route order as above
    gate.js             page-rule resolution + session decision table (pure)

    auth.js             Better Auth factory, plugins, hooks, status field
    mail.js             Resend sender + console fallback
    pages/              login.js signup.js pending.js admin.js layout.js style.css
  test/
    gate.test.js        decision table
    rules.test.js       glob matching, runtime auto-public, first-match
    serve.test.js       cleanUrls, range, 304, 404
    e2e.test.js         miniflare: fixture dist + local D1, anonymous vs active vs pending
```

## Error handling

- Auth errors: rendered into the login/signup page, never raw JSON to a browser.
- Missing R2 object: site 404 page if present, plain 404 otherwise.
- D1 down: 503, fail closed.
- Mail send failure: logged; sign-up still succeeds and the pending page tells the
  user to contact the admin.
- Unknown `/vault/*` path: 404.

## Testing

Vitest with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.

- `gate.js` is pure: (rule, session) → decision. Table-driven tests over every
  combination of {public, protected, disabled} × {none, pending, disabled, active,
  admin} × {navigation, fetch}.
- Rules: glob semantics, first-match, runtime auto-public trigger, explicit override.
- Serve: unchanged behaviors from campaignhq's Worker, with cache header changes.
- End to end against a fixture `dist/` (one HTML page, one `_file/…parquet`, one
  `_observablehq/` chunk) and a local D1: anonymous GET of the page → 302, of the
  parquet → 401; after sign-up → pending; after admin approve → 200 with correct
  `Content-Range` on a ranged parquet fetch.
- Manual: the real campaignhq build on a staging hostname before the route moves.

## Rollout for ICR

1. Create the `of-vault` repo from this spec. Deploy to `vault.healthcampaigns.org`
   pointed at the campaignhq build (`_site/campaignhq/`, the prefix it already uses).
2. Sign up as the first user (becomes admin). Verify pages and DuckDB queries work
   signed in and are blocked signed out.
3. Move the `dashboards.healthcampaigns.org` custom-domain route from the
   `campaignhq` Worker to of-vault. Keep `monitor.healthcampaigns.org`'s 301.
4. Retire `campaignhq/worker/` and point `campaignhq/deploy.sh` at of-vault's
   deploy, or delete it in favor of of-vault's.

## Open questions

None blocking. Later: OAuth providers, per-role rules, one Worker serving several
sites, npm packaging.
